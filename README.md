# contact_form
This project is designed to provide a contact form for a renowned beauty salon, enabling customers to reach out with their queries or messages. It features backend development with pure PHP, form validation, MySQL database storage of submissions, and email notifications to the site owner.
index.php, process.php, config.php, and style.css files are the files used for the contact form. (with 2  images). you have to copy all the files into a single folder
all the data is stored in the SQL database.
You must create a table named "contact_form" in a folder called "beautysalon" for the SQL database to work.
I made sure   - to validate each of the fields to make sure they are filled in with correct and valid input.                                      - that correctly filled input fields remain when an error is shown.                                                                 - to avoid the refresh of the page that gives you duplicate submissions.
feel free to ask any questions regarding the code
No type of AI tools are used to create the code, I made sure to write all the code by myself.
Everything is working fine. However, to be honest I could have made the page better with the use of javascript or php libraries
